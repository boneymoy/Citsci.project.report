Citsci.cauterize is a citizen project about evaluating robust machine learning algorithms in different test scenarios.
Researchers and citizen scientists alike can publish their algorithms and take part in a community endeavor to find general robust machine learning algorithms.

With regards to open source development and stackeoverflow we see that technical experience and solving real world problems is always a valuable activity.
Often these activities are used in CVs to certify problem solving skills.
We will try to motivate people to contribute by giving them the opportunity to certify their experience in malware analysis via the web platform

\begin{itemize}
    \item Scientist need humans as loss functions
    \item Loss function easy for recognizing images
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item harder approach for sound, text, code, etc.
    \item integration of human knowledge
            
    $\rightarrow$ reinforce robustness of trained models

    $\rightarrow$ use human as reference
\end{itemize}
